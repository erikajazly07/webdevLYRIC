        <p style="text-align:center;">What's that supposed to be about, baby?<br>
            Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy<br>
            Reminiscing all the good times daily<br>
            Try and pull that, got me acting shady<br>
            What's that supposed to be about, baby?<br>
            Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy<br>
            You know I give you the good loving daily<br>
            Try and pull that, got me actin' shady<br>
            Oh</p>

            <p style="text-align:center;">You say you love me, say you love me<br>
                But you're never there for me, yeah, uh<br>
                And you'll be cryin', slowly dyin'<br>
                When I decide to leave, yeah, uh<br>
                All we do is make up<br>
                Then break up<br>
                Why don't we wake up and see<br>
                When love hurts<br>
                It won't work<br>
                Yeah, maybe we need some time alone<br>
                We need to let it breathe<br></p>
